# Halal Cart Red Sauce  

## info  
* 30 minutes  
* About 1 cup  

## ingredients  
* 24 small dried red chilies  
* 1 guajillo chili  
* 8 ounces water (6 tbsp reserved after soaking)  
* 6 cloves garlic, smashed  
* 1.5 tbsp olive oil  
* 2 tsp apple cider vinegar  
* 2 tsp ground caraway  
* 2 tsp ground coriander  
* 2 tsp paprika  
* 1 tsp ground cumin  
* 1 tsp salt  

## steps
1. Put the chilies in a small pot with the water and bring to a boil; take off heat and let soak for about 20 minutes until cool enough to handle  
2. Meanwhile, add the garlic, olive oil, vinegar, and spices to the bowl of a food processor  
3. Add 6 tbsp of the chili water  
4. Seed the chilies (or most of them) and add them  
5. Process until very smooth, adding extra chili water if needed  

## notes  
* Meant to mimic the harissa-based hot sauce found at Halal Guys and Mamoun's  
* Try using 2 tbsp cayenne and 2 tbsp scotch bonnet powder, and remove the paprika
