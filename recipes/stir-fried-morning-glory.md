# Pad Pak Boong  
(Thai Stir-Fried Morning Glory)

## ingredients  
* 150 grams morning glory (aka water spinach or *kang kung*)  
* 5–6 cloves garlic, thinly sliced  
* 2–3 Thai chilies, sliced  
* 1 tbsp oyster sauce (preferably Thai)  
* 1 tbsp Tao Jiew (fermented soy bean paste, see note)  
* 1/2 tbsp soy sauce  
* 1 tbsp fish sauce (optional)  
* 1 tsp sugar  
* 1/8–1/4 tsp ground white pepper  
* Water as needed  

## steps
1. Remove thick, tough stems from water spinach, then cut into 3" pieces and wash throroughly; drain excess water  
2. Mix together oyster sauce, tao jiew, soy sauce, sugar, and white pepper; stir until sugar is dissolved  
3. In wok or saucepan, add 2 tbsp oil over high heat  
4. Add garlic and chilies, cook until garlic starts to brown  
5. Add water spinach and sauce, and cook, stirring constantly, until water spinach starts to wilt  
6. Add water if necessary until there is a nice dark liquid in the bottom  
7. Remove spinach from pan and place on a serving plate to stop further cooking; serve immediately  

## notes  
* While probably not ideal, I've substituted broad bean paste instead of soy bean paste and it still comes out very good. The second recipe listed below says the recipe will be ok without either, so that's an option too.
