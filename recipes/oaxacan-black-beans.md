# Frijoles Picosos  
(Picante Beans from Oaxaca)

## ingredients  
* 8 oz dried black beans (or one 14 oz can), broth reserved  
* 10 chiles de árbol (see note) lightly toasted  
* 1/4 tsp achiote paste (optional)  
* 4 cloves garlic, peeled  
* 2 tbsp lard (see note)  
* 2 scallions and 1 bunch chives, roughly chopped (see note)  
* 3 sprigs epazote (or a large pinch of Mexican oregano)  
* Salt to taste

## steps
1. If using dried beans, cook until tender  
2. Put 1 cup bean broth in blender, add chiles, achiote, and garlic and blend until smooth  
3. Heat lard over medium heat in a cast iron skillet, add beans and blended ingredients and cook for 10 minutes  
4. Add scallions/chives, epazote, and salt and cook for another 10 minutes until the beans fully break up  

## notes  
* While you can use chiles de árbol, ideally you should use 20 chiltepes or chiles paisanos  
* Recipe calls for 4 tbsp lard but that's a ton – 2 tbsp should still make creamy beans  
* Ideally should use 8 cebollines instead of the scallions/chives; could also use some finely chopped onions in place of the chives
