# Potato and Green Chili Hash  

## info  
* about an hour  
* a big meal for two  

## ingredients  
* 1.5 lbs russet or Yukon gold potatoes, cut into 1/2" cubes  
* 2 tbsp white vinegar  
* 4 oz Spanish chorizo (or other options, see notes)  
* 1/2 tsp ground cumin  
* 1/4 tsp ground smoked paprika  
* 6 scallions (white/light green parts separated and finely sliced)  
* 1 poblano pepper, cut into 1/2" pieces  
* 4 eggs  
* 1/4 cup cilantro, roughly chopped  

## steps
1. Preheat oven to 375º F  
2. Place potatoes in large pot, cover with water and add vinegar and 2 tbsp kosher salt  
3. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce to a simmer and cook until barely tender, about 5 minutes  
4. Drain in a colander and let sit for about 2 minutes  
5. Put some oil and the chorizo or other meat in a cast iron skillet over medium heat, cooking until crisp  
6. Remove meat to a bowl, but leave fat in the skillet  
7. Add 3 tbsp oil to the skillet and heat over medium-high heat until shimmering  
8. Add potatoes and cook, stirring occasionally, until deep brown and crisp on all sides, about 20 minutes  
9. If using onions instead of scallions, add them about 15 minutes in  
10. Add cumin and paprika, stir, and cook until fragrant  
11. Remove potatoes and set aside  
12. Add 1 tbsp oil to skillet over high heat and add scallions and poblano, cooking until charred, about 2 minutes  
13. Add potatoes and meat, stirring well  
14. Make four wells in the mixture, add some oil in each, and crack in four eggs (see note)  
15. Drizzle entire pan with oil and season liberally with salt and pepper  
16. Cook in the oven until whites are set, about 8–10 minutes  
17. Remove from oven, garnish with green parts of the scallions, cilantro, and (optionally) some saffron on the eggs  
18. Serve with salsa, hot sauce, queso fresco, shaved cheese (like Manchego), and/or homemade tortillas  

## notes  
* Extra good with guasacaca, salsa verde, harissa, etc  
* Instead of Spanish chorizo, try pepperoni, salami, Italian sausage, or Mexican chorizo!  
* The Serious Eats recipe calls for cracking the eggs into a bowl and swishing them in a mesh strainer to remove excess whites; this is optional for sure
