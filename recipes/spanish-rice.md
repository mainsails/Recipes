# Spanish Rice  

## ingredients  
* 1.5 tbsp olive oil  
* 1 cup medium- or long-grain rice (Goya works really well)  
* 1 bay small leaf (or 1/2 larger one)  
* 1/2 onion, very finely chopped (about 1/2 cup)  
* 1 small garlic clove, minced (about 1/2 tsp)  
* 1.5 cups chicken or vegetable stock (should be same amount as on package)  
* 1/2 heaping tbsp tomato paste  
* Pinch dried oregano  
* 1/2 tsp salt    

## steps
1. Heat oil in medium saucepot, add rice and stir to coat. Cook on medium heat, stirring often, until rice is browned (rice should turn opaque white and start to look straw-colored).  
2. Add onion and cook, stirring, until onions begin to soften (about 3 minutes). Add garlic and bay leaf, cook until onions are translucent and softened. Rice will smell very fragrant and start to be darker brown in spots.  
3. Add broth, tomato paste, oregano, and salt.  
4. Bring to a simmer and cook, covered, according to package instructions. (For Goya, simmer for until water is absorbed. For Kohinoor rice, simmer 10 minutes then let sit for 5.)  
5. If necessary, continue cooking under low heat with the lid off, stirring periodically until the rice is firm and starting to break apart.  
6. Fluff with a fork and serve!
