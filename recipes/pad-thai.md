* 4 oz dry rice noodles (medium size)  
* 2 tbsp dried shrimp, medium size, chopped  
* 3 cloves garlic, chopped

## steps  
1. Soak the rice noodles in room-temp water for about an hour, then drain (meanwhile, make the sauce)  
2. Add palm sugar to small pot over medium heat, stirring until it darkens in color (to a dark caramel)  
3. Immediately add water (sugar will harden immediately), then fish sauce and tamarind  
4. Bring sauce to a simmer, turn off heat, and stir  
5. Once soaked, cut the noodles in half using a scissors  
6. In a wok or nonstick skillet, add oil and heat on medium  
7. Add tofu, garlic, shallots, daikon, dried shrimp, and chilies, then cook until garlic starts to turn golden and shallots are wilted  
8. Add a little more oil and turn up to high heat  
9. Add noodles and sauce, toss constantly and cook until sauce is absorbed (if looking too dry, add a little water)  
10. Push noodles to the side of the pan, add a little oil in the empty space and add eggs  
11. Break yolks then put noodles on top of eggs and cook for about 30 seconds, then toss to mix eggs into noodles  
12. Add bean sprouts, garlic chives, and half the peanuts  
13. Turn off heat and toss until well mixed  
14. Serve with a squeeze of lime and extra peanuts on top  

## notes  
* Original recipe calls for 35 grams but was too sweet  
* If making from the compressed block, see the second recipe below; also warns not to use Indian-style which has a different flavor  
* Original recipe suggests Erawan brand noodles
