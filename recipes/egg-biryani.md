## steps

cook rice:
1. rinse and soak the rice in water for at least 30 minutes (this really does make the rice much fluffier!)  
2. (while the rice is soaking, this would be a great time to make the biryani shorba)  
2. in a large pot, lightly toast the dry spices until fragrant  
3. add enough water to cover the rice (the exact amount doesn't matter since we'll be draining it) and bring to a boil  
4. add the rice and cook until about 75% done – this can happen quickly, so start checking about 7–8 minutes in  
5. drain the rice in a collander and spread on a sheet tray to cool  

cook eggs:  
1. fill a pot with 1" water, lay a steamer basket inside (or a bamboo one on top)  
2. heat until the water simmering, then place the eggs in the steamer and cover  
3. maintain a simmer for 13 minutes, then remove the eggs to an ice bath  
4. let the eggs sit for 15 minutes, then knock on the counter all over to break the shell (or do the fancy version in the video)  
5. prick eggs randomly with a fork  
6. heat 1 tsp oil, add dry spices and cook until aromatic  
7. pan-fry the eggs for 4 minutes until well coated  

make saffron milk:
1. optional: toast the saffron for about 30 seconds  
2. heat milk in a pan, pour into bowl and add saffron
3. let sit for at least 30 minutes  

make fried onions:
1. heat 3 tbsp oil on medium
2. add onions and fry until brown
3. drain oil back into pan and put onions in bowl

make gravy:
1. heat oil again (adding more if necessary)
2. add dry spices and cook until fragrant
3. add remaining sliced onions and cook until light golden
4. add garlic-ginger paste and cook for 2 minutes
5. add cashews and cook 1 minute
6. add tomatoes and cook until mushy
7. add other dried spices, chilies, mint and coriander leaves
8. cook four minutes
9. add yogurt, mix and cook 5-7 minutes or until "raw smell is gone"
10. add 1/2 cup water, mix and cook 5 more minutes or until thick
11. remove from heat, remove bay leaf, anise, and cinnamon  
12. blend until smooth but slightly chunky  

assemble:
1. in a pressure cooker or other well-sealing pot, add 1/3 the rice
2. spread 3/4 of the gravy, sprinkle with mint, cilantro, and fried onions
3. add 1/3 rice
4. drizzle with 4 tbsp saffron milk, sprinkle with mint and coriander leaves
5. arrange egg halves, add remaining gravy
6. add remaining rice, drizzle with remaining saffron milk
7. sprinkle with remaining mint and coriander leaves, fried onions

heat through:
1. put the lid tightly on the pot but be sure the pressure valve is released  
2. place in another larger pot filled with water about 1–2" above the bottom of the pressure cooker  
3. heat the biryani for about 20 minutes, adding water to the pot below as necessary  
4. let sit for at least 10 minutes before serving  
5. serve with biryani shorba and cucumber raita  

## notes
* Gravy, biryani shorba, and cucumber raita take quite a while to make so start them all early!
