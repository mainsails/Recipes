# Carne Asada  

## ingredients  
* 2.5 lbs flank steak  
* 1/4 cup soy sauce  
* 1/4 cup lime juice  
* 2 tbsp sugar  
* 1 tbsp dried ground ancho chile (or dried chipotle)  
* 1 tbsp dried oregano  
* 2 tsp ground cumin  
* 4 cloves garlic, chopped  
* 2 tbsp chopped cilantro  
* 1/3 cup olive oil  

## steps
1. Combine marinate ingredients (except the oil) in a shallow bowl, whisk. Slowly whisk in oil.  
2. Add steak and coat with marinade (alternatively, place everthing in a ziplock bag). Let marinate for at least an hour and up to 12, turning every few hours.    
3. Remove steak from marinade and pat dry. Cook over charcoal (first on hot side then cooler) or in a cast-iron pan until center registers 135ÂºF. Transfer to a cutting board and allow to rest for 5 minutes.  
4. Slice steak across grain, serve with tortillas, onion and cilantro, and salsa.
