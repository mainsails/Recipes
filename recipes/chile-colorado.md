# Chile Colorado

## ingredients  
* 5 ancho chiles  
* 2 pasilla chiles  
* 2 guajillo chiles  
* 8 cups chicken stock  
* 2 pounds boneless pork shoulder, cut into 1/2" pieces  
* 6 cloves garlic, chopped  
* 2 bay leaves  
* 1 tbsp ground cumin  
* 2 tsp chopped fresh sage  
* 2 tsp chopped fresh Mexican oregano (or 1 tsp dried)  
* 1 stick cinnamon, broken into large pieces (optional)  
* Chopped cilantro as garnish

## steps
1. Remove stems and seeds from the chiles  
2. Heat three cups chicken stock in a small pot until boiling  
3. Take off heat, add chiles, cover and soak for about 30 minutes, until chiles are plump and tender  
4. Put chiles and all soaking liquid into a blender and puree until very smooth  
5. Meanwhile, cut pork into 1/2" pieces and season with salt and pepper  
6. Heat oil over medium-high heat in a large pot, cook pork in small batches until is browned (doing all the pork at once crowds the pan and it just steams)  
7. Add garlic, bay leaves, cumin, and fresh herbs, stirring until very fragrant  
8. Add the pork and remaining stock and cook, uncovered, for an hour  
9. Add chile puree and cook for another 45 minutes until meat is very tender and sauce is a thick, mahogany-red color  
10. Season with salt to taste, serve with rice and homemade flour tortillas  

## notes  
* Adding a stick of cinnamon, like carnitas, adds a nice woody depth  
* Could try making this with butternut squash in place of the meat  
* Things to try: top with sesame seeds, like mole
