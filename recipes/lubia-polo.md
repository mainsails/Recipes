Persian Green Bean Rice  

## info  
* About 2 hours  
* 6 cups rice with fixings (a lot)  

## ingredients  
* 2 tbsp olive oil  
* 8 oz ground beef or lamb (93% lean)  
* 1 onion, chopped  
* 1 tsp turmeric  
* 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper  
* 1 tsp curry powder  
* 1/2 tsp ground cinnamon  
* 1 tsp salt  
* 2 tbsp tomato paste  
* 1/2 cup water  
* 1 lb green beans, cut into 1/2" pieces  

For the rice:  
* 6 cups water  
* 2 cups basmati rice (well rinsed to remove starch)  
* 1.5 tsp salt  
* 6 tbsp olive oil  
* 2 small potatoes, cut into 1/2" thick slices  
* 1/4 bloomed saffron  

## steps
1. Heat oil in skillet over medium heat.  
2. Sautee onion until golden brown, then add beef/lamb and cook until no longer pink.  
3. Add spices and cook until fragrant.  
4. Add tomato paste and water, mix to combine and add green beans. Bring to a low simmer, cover, and cook until green beans are fully cooked, adding more water if necessary.  
5. Bring a water (with salt) to a boil, then add rice and boil for about 5–6 minutes. Rice should be able to be broken apart with your fingers but still hard in the middle.  
6. Transfer rice to a colander and rinse to stop cooking.  
7. Place pot back on burner over medium heat. When pot is dry inside, add 3 tbsp olive oil and arrange potato slices to cover the bottom of the pot.  
8. Scoop 1/3 of the rice over the potatoes. Layer with bloomed saffron and 1/3 green bean mixture. Repeat two more times, creating a mountain-shape in the top that comes to a peak.  
9. Pour 1/3 cup water around the edges and cover the pot in a kitchen towel (for fluffy rice) and then the pot lid.  
10. Cook for about 15 minutes; lift to let the steam escape and pour the remaining 3 tbsp oil on the rice.  
11. Cover and cook again for another 30 minutes until rice is fully cooked and flavors combined. Fluff the rice and serve.  

## notes  
* Could be spicier! Add more cayenne or some sliced Thai chiles in there.  
* Basically a Persian biryani – would be great with some thin yogurt sauce on top.
