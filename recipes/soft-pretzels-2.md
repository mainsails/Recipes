# Soft Pretzels 
Variation #2, from Andrea Slonecker's "Pretzel Making at Home"  

## info  
* Make dough 24 hours in advance, then about 1 hour  
* 8 pretzels  

## ingredients  
* 7 grams active dry yeast (or one 1/4-oz package)  
* 120 ml warm water (between 100–115ºF)  
* 1 tbsp barley malt syrup (or firmly-packed brown sugar)  
* 420 grams unbleached bread flour  
* 120 ml cold beer (pilsner-style is best)  
* 2 tbsp unsalted butter, cubed, at room temp  
* 2 tsp kosher or fine sea salt  
* Baked baking soda (1/4-cup) or lye solution (2 tbsp)  
* 1 large egg yolk (if using baking soda)  
* Pretzel salt or other toppings as desired  

## steps
1. Add warm water to bowl of stand mixer  
2. Sprinkle with yeast and stir in barley malt syrup/brown sugar  
3. Allow yeast to bloom until foamy, about 5–7 minutes  
4. Add flour, beer, butter, and salt and stir until a shaggy mass forms  
5. Using dough hook, knead on medium-low; after about 1 minute dough should be firm and slightly tacky but not sticky (add additional flour/water if necessary)  
6. Continue kneading on medium-low speed until elastic, about 5–7 minutes  
7. Grease a large bowl with butter or olive oil  
8. Transfer dough and cover tightly; place in fridge overnight (or minimum of 1.5 hours, until dough is doubled in size)  

Prepare the baked baking soda solution:
1. Preheat oven to 250º F  
2. On a foil-lined baking sheet, spread out 1/4-cup baking soda  
3. Place in oven and bake for one hour (will loose a lot of weight while cooking)  
4. Allow to cool completely before using (see note)  
5. When ready to cook the pretzels, fill a large pot with enough room for 8 cups of water and 2" space at the top  
6. Pour in baked baking soda, stir, and bring to a simmer over medium-high heat  
7. Once baking soda dissolves, reduce to a gentle simmer  
8. Before baking, brush tops of pretzels with egg-wash mixture of 1 egg yolk beaten with 1 tbsp water for a nice, glossy finish  

Alternatively, prepare the lye solution:  
1. Fill a large pot with enough room for 6 cups water and 2" space at the top  
2. Wearing rubber gloves, add lye 1 tbsp at a time  
3. Warm over high heat until wisps of steam start to appear  
4. Remove from heat and allow to cool until the steam subsides, about 5 minutes  

Shape the dough:  
1. Line two rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper  
2. Turn dough out onto unfloured surface; press down firmly to deflate the dough  
3. Cut into 8 pieces and keep covered with a damp towel  
4. Pat each piece into a rectangle approximately 3.5x5.5"  
5. Roll out into log-shape that is thinner on the ends and fatter in the center  
6. When the dough won't roll out any further (probably at about 12–16" long), set aside and continue with remaining pieces)  
7. Roll all dough pieces out to about 24–28" long, with center about 1" in diameter  
8. Roll into pretzel shape  
9. Place on baking sheets and cover with a damp towel, repeating for all dough pieces  
10. Let rise in warm room temp until 50% larger, about 20–30 minutes (see note)
11. Preheat oven to 500º F  

Dipping:  
1. Heat baking soda/lye solution according to directions above  
2. Gently dip pretzels in the solution, one of two at a time, for about 20 seconds, turning after about 10 seconds  
3. Remove immediately, drain, and return to baking sheet, leaving them at least 1" apart  

Topping and baking:  
1. With a sharp knife or razor, cut a 1/4"-deep slit in the fattest part of the pretzel to release steam  
2. If using baked baking soda solution, brush with egg wash mixture  
3. Bake until a deep mahogany color, about 8–12 minutes, rotating and flipping pans halfway through baking time  
4. Transfer pretzels to a cooling rack for at least 10 minutes, eat as soon as possible :)  

## notes  
* The baked baking soda can be kept in an air-tight container at room temp indefinitely, so consider baking an entire box in one go  
* If you need more friction while rolling, spray the work surface with water and a little on your hands  
* After shaping and their final rise, they can be covered in plastic wrap and stored in the fridge for up to 8 hours before dipping and baking)  
* Can be stored wrapped in plastic wrap for 2 days  
* Spelt dough: sub 155 grams whole-grain spelt flour for 160g of the bread flour  
* Everything topping: mix 1 tbsp plus 1 tsp each minced onion, minced garlic, sesame seeds, poppy seeds, and coarse salt in a bowl; scatter over pretzels before baking
