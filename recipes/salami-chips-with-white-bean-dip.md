# Salami Chips  
**With garlic-heavy white bean dip**

## ingredients
* pre-sliced Genoa salami (about an ounce per person)  

for white bean dip:  
* 1 whole head of garlic, cloves separated but unpeeled

* hearty amount of black pepper  

## steps  

make the salami chips:  
1. preheat oven to 375º F  
2. place salami slices on baking sheet (can be close together – they'll shrink as they cook)  
3. bake for about 10 minutes until crispy, stiff, and edges start to brown and curl  
4. transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to remove excess fat  
5. serve with dip below, or hummus  

make the bean dip:  
1. in a dry cast iron skillet, roast the garlic cloves until soft (or do this in the oven)  
2. put peeled cloves in a food processor with the remaining ingredients, pulse until smooth  
3. add warm water to thin, if necessary  
4. transfer to bowl or plate, drizzle with olive oil
