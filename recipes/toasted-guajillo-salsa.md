# Toasted Guajillo Salsa  

## ingredients  
* 2 oz dried guajillo chiles (about 9), stems removed  
* 3 cloves garlic, unpeeled  
* 3/4 tsp kosher salt  
* 1.5 tbsp apple cider vinegar  
* 1/2 tsp garlic powder  
* 1/2 tsp onion powder  

## steps
1. Toast chiles in a cast iron skillet over medium-high heat, until slightly puffed and fragrant, about 15–20 seconds per side.  
2. Toast garlic as well, turning often, until lightly charred and soft, about 8 minutes. Remove peel and trim ends.  
3. Remove seeds from chiles. In a medium bowl filled with 1 cup very hot water, cut chiles with a scissors into thin rings and let soak for 10 minutes.  
4. Transfer chiles and liquid, garlic, vinegar, and seasonings to a blender. Pulse until a thick purée forms.  

## notes  
* Great with chips or as a sauce for enchiladas.
