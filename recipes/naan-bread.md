# Naan Bread

## ingredients
* 150g strong white bread flour
* 75ml warm water
* 2.5 tbsp natural yoghurt
* 1 tbsp butter
* 3/4 tsp yeast
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 1/2 tsp sugar

## steps
Preparation:
1. Put the yeast, sugar and two tablespoons of warm water in a bowl and stir well. Leave until it begins to froth
2. Put the flour and salt into a large mixing bowl and whisk to combine
3. Stir the yoghurt into mixture and make a well in the middle of the flour, pouring the melted butter into it
4. Mix, then gradually stir in the water to make a soft, sticky mixture that is just firm enough to call a dough, but not at all dry
5. Tip out on a lightly floured surface and knead for about five minutes until smooth and a little less sticky
6. Put in a large, lightly oiled bowl and cover and leave in a warm place until doubled in size (~90–120 minutes)
7. Tip the dough back out on to the lightly floured surface, knock the air out and divide into balls
8. Flatten the balls circle, slightly thicker around the edge

Cooking:
1. Preheat a pizza stone in an oven on max
2. Pick up the dough by the top to stretch it slightly into a teardrop shape and place on pizza stone under grill
3. Brush with melted butter/garlic
