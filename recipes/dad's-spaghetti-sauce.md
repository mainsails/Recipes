# Dad's Spaghetti Sauce  

## info  
* 2–4 hours  
* Enough for several meals  

## ingredients  
* 1 lbs ground beef  
* 1 large onion, diced  
* 3–4 cloves of garlic, minced  
* One 28-oz and one 15-oz can of tomato sauce  
* 3 tbsp dried organo  
* 3 tbsp dried basil  
* 1 tbsp dried parsley  
* 1 tbsp dried sage  
* 1 tsp dried thyme  
* 1 tsp dried rosemary  
* Salt, pepper, and red pepper flakes to taste  

## steps  
1. In a skillet, brown the ground beef and onion until cooked through  
2. Just before the meat is cooked, add the minced garlic and cook until aromatic  
3. Drain the fat and transfer the meat back to the pan  
4. Add tomato and spices, bring to a boil then reduce the heat and simmer for 2–4 hours, stirring every 15–20 minutes, until thickened and flavor is developed  
5. After about 30–60 minutes, dd additional oregano, basil, and salt/pepper as needed  

## notes  
* Dad suggests using a 50/50 blend of ground beef and Italian sausage, omitting the sage if you do that  
* He also suggests a glass of Valpolicella, which "will make up for any deficiency in the direction or preparation" :)  

## based on  
* My dad's own recipe, which I remember fondly as a kind (and still enjoy every time we go home!)
