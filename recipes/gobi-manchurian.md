## steps  
1. Cut cauliflower into florets, add to 3 cups hot water and let rest for five minutes; drain and dry with a towel  
2. While cauliflower is soaking, make batter by mixing corn starch, flour, chili powder, pepper and salt in a small bowl; add a little water as needed so the batter is smooth and flows easily  
3. Heat oil in a pot  
4. Coat cauliflower in batter and gently drop in the oil, stirring for even frying  
5. Remove to drain in a colander when golden and crisp (can also be re-fried for extra crisp results!)  

Make the sauce:  
1. Heat oil in a wide pan  
3. Add garlic, ginger, and chilies and sautee for 1–2 minutes  
4. Add onions and sautee for 2 minutes on high heat  
5. Add soy sauce, Sriracha, chili powder, sugar, and vinegar  
6. Add water and black pepper, stir and cook over medium heat until sauce thickens  
7. Take off heat and add salt to taste  
8. Add fried cauliflower and stir to coat, garnish with green onions and serve immediately
