# Soft Pretzels
Variation #1, from Alton Brown  

## ingredients
* 1.5 cups warm water (110–115º F)  
* 1 tbsp sugar  
* 2 tsp kosher salt  
* 1 package active dry yeast  
* 22-oz (1-lb, 6-oz) all-purpose flour (approx 4.5 cups)  
* 2 oz unsalted butter, melted  
* 10 cups water  
* 2/3 cup baking soda  
* vegetable oil (for the baking sheet)  
* 1 large egg yolk, beaten with 1 tbsp water  
* kosher or pretzel salt for topping  

## steps

make the dough:  
1. Combine the water, sugar, and kosher salt in a large mixing bowl and sprinkle yeast on top  
2. Let sit for 5 minutes or until the yeast begins to foam  
3. Add the flour and melted butter and mix using your hands until well combined and pulls away from the sides of the bowl  
4. Knead the dough until smooth and gluten is well-developed (either by hand, or in a stand mixer or bread machine)  
5. Clean bowl, oil with vegetable oil  
6. Return dough to the bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and let sit in a warm place for 50-55 minutes or until dough has doubled in size  

prepare oven and water:  
1. Preheat the oven to 450º F  
2. Line two baking pans with parchment paper and lightly brush with vegetable oil  
3. Bring 10 cups of water and the baking soda to a rolling boil  

roll the pretzels:  
1. Turn the dough out onto an oiled (not floured!) work surface and divide into 8 equal pieces  
2. Roll each piece into a 12-inch rope  
3. Make each rope into a pretzel shape ([like this](images/pretzel-shape.jpg))  

boil and bake:  
1. Place the pretzels in the boiling water, one-by-one, and boil for 30 seconds  
2. Remove from water using a flat spatula and place on oiled baking sheet  
3. When all are ready, brush the tops with the beaten egg yolk/water mixture and sprinkle with salt  
4. Bake until dark golden brown in color, approx 12–14 minutes  
5. Cool on a wire rack at least 5 minutes before serving  

## notes  
* If not enough room, making sixteen 12-inch ropes works too  
* The baking soda water gives off messy steam – boil in a really tall pot if possible
