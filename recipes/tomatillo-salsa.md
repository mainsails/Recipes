# Tomatillo Salsa  

## ingredients  
* \~5 tomatillos, husked and halved  
* 1 serrano, stem removed and halved the long way  
* 1/2 small white onion, finely chopped  
* Cilantro, minced, to taste  
* Salt, to taste  

## steps
1. In a cast iron skillet on medium-high heat, dry roast the tomatillos and serrano face down until darkened  
2. Flip and roast other side until lightly charred  
3. Put tomatillos and serrano in a blender and puree, adding water as needed  
4. Chop the onion and rinse thoroughly in water to remove the sharp taste  
5. Add onion and cilantro to the salsa only when cool! The hot salsa will cause the onion to cook and will alter its flavor  

## notes  
* For milder salsa, remove the seeds from the serrano
