# Hummus

## ingredients  
* 1/2 lb dried chickpeas  
* 1 tsp baking soda  
* 2 tbsp kosher salt  
* 6 cups cold water  

For the tahini  
* 1 whole head garlic, broken into individual unpeeled cloves  
* 2/3 cup fresh lemon juice (about 3–4 lemons)  
* 1/2 tsp ground cumin  
* 1 cup tahini paste (about 10 oz)  

For the hummus  
* 1 tsp baking soda  
* 1 tbsp salt  
* 1 small onion, split in half  
* 1 stalk celery  
* 1 carrot  
* 2 medium cloves garlic  
* 2 bay leaves  
* 6 cups water  
* 1.5 cups tahini (see above)  
* Olive oil, za'tar, and/or paprika for serving  

## steps
1. Combine beans, baking soda, salt, and water in a large bowl; let stand at room temperature overnight; when ready, drain and rinse thoroughly  
2. Place beans in Dutch oven, add baking soda, salt, onion, celery, carrot, garlic, bay leaves, and water  
3. Bring to a boil over high heat, reduce to a simmer with cover cracked and cook until completely tender to the point of falling apart, about 2 hours, adding more water if necessary  

Make the tahini  
1. Combine garlic and lenom juice in a blender, pulse until a pulpy puree is formed  
2. Transfer to a fine mesh strainer over a large bowl; press out as much liquid as possible with the back of a spoon, then discard solids  
3. Add cumin and tahini paste, whisk to combine – mixture will seize up and turn pasty, add a few tablespoons water, whisking between, until smooth and light (should lose its shape it you let ribbons drop from the whisk into the bowl)  
4. Season to taste with salt  

Finish the hummus  
1. Discard onion, celery, and bay leaves; transfer everything else to a food processor with enough cooking liquid to cover them  
2. Pulse slowly to mix, then increase speed to high until the texture of a thick milkshake, about two minutes (may need to remove inset and cover with a towel to allow steam to escape)  
3. Transfer to a large bowl and whisk in tahini sauce; whisk in salt to taste  
4. Let cool to room temp (should thicken to hold its shape), drizzle with olive oil and sprinkle with za'atar and/or paprika

## notes  
* Tahini and hummus will keep in the fridge for up to 1–1.5 weeks  
* Canned chickpeas will work – see the Serious Eats recipe (at the bottom) for info
