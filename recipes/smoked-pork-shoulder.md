# Smoked Pork Shoulder  

## info  
* About 6–8 hours  
* Varies  

## ingredients
* Dry rub from the Memphis-Style Ribs recipe  
* 2–4 lbs boneless pork shoulder (butt)  
* Apple wood chunks (or pecan)  

## steps  
1. Make dry rub in a small container  
2. Trim excess fat, then score fatty side with a knife  
3. If not already tied, wrap the bork butt with butcher's string to keep it tight and no little bits sticking out  
4. Apply liberal amount of rub to pork, cover and refridgerate overnight  
5. About an hour before cooking, remove from fridge  
6. Lay three lines of charcoal briquettes along the side of the grill (aka the "snake" method) about 3/4 of the way around, with wood chunks along the top (see note)  
7. Light 8–12 briquettes, then add to one side of the snake  
8. Place an aluminum pan of water in the center  
9. When grill has reached 250º F, place pork shoulder above the drip pan  
10. Smoke until internal temperature reaches 195–205º F (see note)  
11. Remove from smoker and wrap in butcher paper (or aluminum foil) and place in a cooler to rest for one hour  
12. Shred and serve!  

## notes  
* Wood chunks should *not* touch each other! This will cause the snake to ignite quickly and won't get that nice slow cook. Wood chips can also be used under the top layer of briquettes, but should also not touch  
* Some folks say to tightly wrap the pork butt in foil or butcher paper when it reaches 160º F (the temp where the "stall" happens), then return it to the grill wrapped and cook until done. You can spray the pork butt before wrapping with 1/2 water, 1/2 apple cider vinegar too add some moisture too. If wrapping, there's no need for wood chunks in the second half of the snake, since it can't penetrate the foil/paper  
* Is great with mac-n-cheese or a fried egg!
