# Memphis-Style Ribs

## ingredients  
* 2 racks baby-back or St. Louis-cut spare ribs  

Dry rub:  
* 1/2 cup paprika  
* 1/3 cup dark brown sugar  
* 2 tbsp kosher salt  
* 2 tbsp granulated garlic  
* 1 tbsp celery salt  
* 1 tbsp chili powder  
* 1 tbsp black pepper  
* 2 tsp onion powder  
* 2 tsp dried thyme  
* 2 tsp dried oregano  
* 2 tsp mustard powder  
* 1 tsp celery seed  
* 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper  

For the mop:  
* 3/4 cup distilled white vinegar  
* 3/4 cup water  
* 1/4 cup plus 2 tbsp dry rub 

## steps
1. Mix together the dry rub ingredients in a tupperware container  
2. Arrange charcoal briquettes in the snake method about 2/3-way around the grill; spread wood chip or chunks on top. Light 8-10 briquettes in a chimney and, when lit, add to one end of the snake.
3. Place a pan of water on the bottom of the grill opposite the coals.  
4. Place the grill grate back on, open all vents, and let the grill come up to temp, about 250ºF.  
5. Add the ribs on the cool side of the grill.  
6. Whisk together mop ingredients in a small bowl.  
7. Brush every 20 minutes with mop, rotating or flipping ribs as necessary.  
8. Cook ribs until internal temperature is about 195ºF, ribs bend and start to pull apart when held at one end, and a toothpick goes through the meaty part without resistance, about 4–5 hours. To be certain they are done, cut off one rib: the meat should be white inside (though smoke ring may appear pink).  
9. Finish with a few minutes over the hot side, if desired.  
10. Transfer ribs to a cutting board and coat with mop (and extra dry rub, if desired), let rest for 5 minutes. Slice and serve with BBQ sauce for dipping.  

## notes  
* Original recipe calls for a ton of salt; this version cuts that in half.  
* Original recipe also includes a method for a much faster cook time; slower = more smoke flavor.
