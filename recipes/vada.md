# Vada
Puffy little fried Indian snacks (supposed to be for breakfast but shrug)

## ingredients
* 1 cup urad dal  
* 1 tsp cumin seed  
* 1 tsp whole black peppercorns  
* 1-2 sprig curry leaves, chopped  
* 1-2 green chilies, chopped  
* 1 tbsp ginger, finely chopped  
* Salt to taste  
* Oil for deep frying  

## steps
1. Soak urad dal for 4 hours to overnight, drain  
2. Grind in blender until a smooth and thick paste (add a little water if necessary)  
3. Put in mixing bowl and whip with hands for 2-3 minutes until fluffy  
4. Add spices, herbs, and salt and whip again to combine  

To fry:

1. Heat oil over medium/medium-high heat  
2. Take a bowl of water, wet hands, and form small balls  
3. Slide into oil and cook, flipping often, until golden  
4. Drain on paper towels  

## notes
* Might want to add more spices!  
* Adding baking soda does make them puffier, but they stick to the bottom and cook weird (and they don't taste any better)  
* If making again another day, let the batter reach room temp before frying (otherwise they will look super nice on the outside but not cook all the way through)
