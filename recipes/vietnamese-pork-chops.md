2. add palm sugar and fish sauce, continue to process until a rough paste  
3. in a shallow tray, pour in marinade and add pork, turning to coat all surfaces  
4. marinate at room temp, turning pork once or twice, for 30 mins to 3 hours; or marinate in fridge for up to 12 hours  

**prepare sauce:**

4. use immediately or store in an air-tight container in the fridge  

**cook the pork:**
